Project #1

http://eve.kean.edu/~reidsc/project1.py

Description: This program was created to find the percentage of people that graduate per state via 2022 enrollment numbers and 2022 graduation numbers. The code itself is ~95% accurate due to not taking into account people that drop out/transfer which would affect the total enrollment number per state.

Project #2

http://eve.kean.edu/~reidsc/pythonencryption.py

Description: This program was orignally created as extra credit for a class but then built upon to add email functionality so that the user could email the required files for the decryption part of the program to work. It should theoretically be able to encrypt and decrypt any file as long as the intended file is in the same folder as the program itself.

Project #3

http://eve.kean.edu/~reidsc/pythontranslator.py

Description: This program was created to give users the ability to have a quick and easy translator that also allows them have full conversations with someone if both parties don't speak the same langauge using Google Translate.
